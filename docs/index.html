            Group 25 redesigned and improved the Classfind website to better allow the user to interact with the system easier and more efficiently. The Classfind website is a navigational tool made for Canadian University campuses so that students could easily find the locations of their lectures, check their schedules, and provide campus links for quick access to their corresponding university resources. The team personally used this website during our early days at Western and it is a tool that is personal to us as current students in our University careers. Thus, we loved the idea of creating a website with a clear functional use outside of achieving goals of a class project and having the chance to redesign a tool that is relevant to past, current, and future students.

            The original website design is cluttered and has some server usability issues that make it difficult for the user to find useful and up-to-date information on the website. The website has several nonfunctional features and the general layout is very overwhelming with poor color choices that lead to confusion for the students. The team’s redesign focused on Western University’s Classfind only (as there were Classfinds’ for other Ontario Universities)  and the website was made to fit all the usability goals and principles of a product and aimed to employ a user-centered design methodology for the prototype. It helped enhance the user experiences and ease for the students to find accurate information by conducting the design process in an intuitive way and meeting the target audience’s needs. Most of the design choices were picked to implement in the website for good functionality, and accessibility and focused heavily on improving the user experience.
