    <div class=" idyll-text-container"><h1 id="employed-design-principles">Employed Design Principles</h1><h3 id="1.-metaphor">1<!-- -->. Metaphor</h3><p>Our new logo of Classfind is a recognizable symbol that helps the user navigate their way through the digital world. It has an expanded map and a dropped pin represents the user’s desired location. The new logo helps orient and guide the user by providing a sense of direction and finding their way with ease and confidence. </p><p>The previous logo used on the website featured an arrow design, which may not have been as intuitive for navigation purposes. Moreover, the green color used in the logo lacked a clear association with any particular concept.  </p><h3 id="2.-representations">2<!-- -->. Representations</h3><p>The color purple is a part of Western University’s branding, so this color theme is used extensively throughout the website to reflect the institution’s identity. It reinforces the connection between the content on the site and the Western brand by utilizing a consistent purple color scheme throughout the site. It helps to create a visually appealing user experience that aligns with the branding of Western University. </p><h3 id="3.-hick’s-law">3<!-- -->. Hick’s Law</h3><p>The original website did not take Hick’s Law into account when they designed the webpage. The sheer volume of text present on the screen overwhelmed users. We have addressed this in our re-design, opting not to blast the front page of the website with so many clickable links the user needs a considerable time just to find where they wish to go. We have grouped the pages together that have similarities (various social media) under links at the top of the page which accurately describe the grouping (Media). The user no longer has to parse the entire page just to find where the map of campus is.</p><h3 id="4.-mapping">4<!-- -->. Mapping</h3><p>Mapping occurs in the layout of the campus map, which provides the user with a clear and intuitive pathway to classes and bus stops. It shows the relationship between the website controls and the user’s controls. </p><h3 id="5.-constraints">5<!-- -->. Constraints</h3><p>The constraints of the website would be if the user does not have a login account, they are limited in not being able to save their favourites, restricting the user from experiencing the full amount of interaction available. </p><h3 id="6.-consistency">6<!-- -->. Consistency</h3><p>All the website tabs are designed to be consistent with the same color and same font, layout, and navigation across pages to create a cohesive user experience. The user can quickly and easily understand how to interact with the site if it is consistent once the user figures out how to use the first tab. When a user is browsing the website, the general layout is clear and clean to browse. The weather widget has been designed with a distinct color, shape and style to clearly indicate to the user that it is solely a display element and not meant for tapping. This deliberate design choice ensures that the user can easily distinguish between a widget meant for interaction and one intended for display only. </p><p>The original website’s use of a different color for each tab’s background can cause confusion for the user and detracts from the overall appeal of the design. Additionally, the inconsistency in the background color further adds to the disjointed and unappealing visual experience. </p><h3 id="7.-feedback">7<!-- -->. Feedback</h3><p>There is an email shown on the foot page to contact the technology department (group 25) to inform us if there are any mistakes or not up-to-date information on the website. There is a platform of communication for the user to input their feedback on the website. And the team could thank them and improve the website upon the website.  </p><h3 id="8.-visibility">8<!-- -->. Visibility</h3><p>The headings are clear and prominent and the layout is consistent using color schemes and typography when creating a visual identity and making a user navigate the site easier. Clear instruction and concise error messages pop out to explain why a situation happened and how to fix the following issues according to the user.  </p><h3 id="9.-affordance">9<!-- -->. Affordance</h3><p>The name of the website is called Western Classfind, which is using the affordance interaction to provide clear and recognizable cues that guide users for its use. The purpose of the website is to find class information and its location at Western University. </p><h3 id="10.-working-memory">1<!-- -->0<!-- -->. Working Memory</h3><p>By using the same site-wide header with tabs consistently on every page of our site, we do not rely on users to remember what other pages they can access on the site.</p><h3 id="11.-80/20-rule">1<!-- -->1<!-- -->. <!-- -->8<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->0 <!-- -->Rule</h3><p>The previous design was very cluttered and did not make the best use of this rule. Our new design moves everything to different tabs, opting to show the user a descriptive label of the elements grouped (20%) instead of everything (80%).</p><h3 id="12.-colour">1<!-- -->2<!-- -->. Colour</h3><p>Since Western’s colour is purple it was easy to choose the base colour for our website. From there we based the rest of our colour choices on how well they complement purple, and  the potential negative effects matching it with purple could have for color blind people. However, the color of green and blue is the main color theme of the old website throughout the university, and it will cause user confusion on which university the user picked previously.</p><h3 id="13.-semiotics">1<!-- -->3<!-- -->. Semiotics</h3><p>We have signs with Iconic relationships. The map of campus as well as the maps of bus routes have physical resemblance to the actual physical campus.</p><h3 id="14.-proximity">1<!-- -->4<!-- -->. Proximity</h3><p>All links (Home, different tabs, login) are located together in the header while the pages you can reach from each individual tab are located together on the actual webpage.</p><h3 id="15.-fitt’s-law">1<!-- -->5<!-- -->. Fitt’s Law</h3><p>The different tabs in the header can be accessed only by clicking on the underlined text that describes it, as opposed to having a larger area around it designated as a button. This allows the links to be both well defined, and well spaced so users don’t accidentally click on the wrong tab.</p><p>Our Design:</p><p>What We Avoided:</p><h3 id="16.-simplicity">1<!-- -->6<!-- -->. Simplicity</h3><p>The design of the website is user-friendly and easy to navigate. The front-end interface is clean and uncluttered. It is easy for the user to navigate and understand the purpose and meaning of each page. Users can quickly and easily anticipate what they will find on each tab before they even open it. We moved much of what was on the first page into different tabs that have both literal and metaphorical representations.</p><p>The previous iteration of the website was extremely cluttered with the designers opting to fit as much in as small a space as possible making users spend a long amount of time just taking everything that’s on the page in. The old design attempted to use Layering and only use one webpage to display all info, we believe this design principle was misused here and contributed to the overall clutter feel of the site.</p><h3 id="17.-picture-superiority-effect">1<!-- -->7<!-- -->. Picture Superiority Effect</h3><p>All clickable tabs are accompanied by pictures that represent what is on that tab. This could potentially mitigate any misclicks by people not intently reading what the tab is as we have Links and Login, both 5 letter words starting with L. The inclusion of pictures will make it easier to differentiate between these two and to keep consistent it makes sense to give all tabs pictures.</p><h3 id="18.-negative-space">1<!-- -->8<!-- -->. Negative Space</h3><p>The previous design was too busy, making extensive use of the colours, blue, green, and red. We have opted to mainly use purple since it is Western’s colour and have used the natural whitespace of the webpage to compliment it. This makes the design easier to discern at first glance and less intense on the eyes.</p><h3 id="19.-emphasis">1<!-- -->9<!-- -->. Emphasis</h3><p>It was important for us that the user’s attention be directed towards the tabs on the top of the page. We emphasized these clickable words by adding underlines, something that is missing from non-clickable words in the header. The previous design had many clickable and non-clickable words grouped together with no indication of which was which. (Clickable shown with checkmark, unclickable with X)</p><h3 id="20.-balance">2<!-- -->0<!-- -->. Balance</h3><p>The previous design was asymmetrical, having a larger layered section on the right ⅔ of the page and static links on the left ⅓. We opted for a more symmetrical redesign, laying out all tab links horizontally in the header while displaying the elements in the middle of the page.</p></div></div></div></div>
